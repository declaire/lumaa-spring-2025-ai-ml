# Book Recommendation System

## Summary
This project is a Book Recommendation System that suggests books on mindfulness and mental health based on user input. It utilizes the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to compute semantic similarities between input descriptions and book summaries.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of ~300 book summaries about mindfulness and mental health (Source: https://fourminutebooks.com/category/mindfulness/). It is stored as a CSV file (`data/mindfulness_books.csv`) with the following structure:

- `book_id`: ID of the book
- `book_name`: Title of the book
- `summaries`: Short descriptions of the book
- `categories`: Genres of the book

## Setup
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Code
To run the recommendation system, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python recommend.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a book description and the number of recommendations you want.

## Results
After running the script, the system will output a list of recommended books based on the input description. Example output:
```
Enter a book description: Guide to maintaining a good work/life balance
